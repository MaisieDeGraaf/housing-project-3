# housing-project-3

For Project 3, we are analyzing listings in 5 cities (Oshawa, Oakville, Burlington, Vaughan and Milton).
We will be looking at the different building types (townhouses, condos & houses), prices and properties for each listing per city
Using that data, we will display the notable tendencies on maps and charts with a focus on neighborhoods.
This will help create a filtered website around the 5 cities

+ Data & Delivery
We will scrap website to obtain listings for each city and store them in a MongoDB database.
The Data will then be clean using a dataframe and displayed in our API endpoint using Flask.
+ Back End & Visualization
Using JS, we will create various maps using Plotly and Leaflet to display each listing filtered by prices/cities/and other possibilities.
A Bar chart will also be created to display average, low and high prices in each city.
