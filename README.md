# Ontario Housing Market Analysis in Ontario

# Project Overview
1. For Project 3, we are analyzing listings in 5 cities (Oshawa, Oakville, Burlington, Vaughan and Milton) in Ontario and building a website with various filters across these 5 cities. 
2. We will be looking at the different building types (townhouses, condos & houses), prices and properties for each listing per city.
3. Using the data created, we will display the notable tendencies on maps and charts with a focus on neighborhoods.

# Methodology
1. Data & Delivery
	a. We will scrape websites to obtain listings for each city and store them in a MongoDB database.
	b. We will then cleanse the data using a dataframe and displayed in our API endpoint using Flask.
2. Back End & Visualization
	a. Using JS, we will create various maps using Plotly, D3, Bootstrap, and Leaflet to display each listing filtered by prices/cities/and other possibilities.
	b. We will create multiple charts and graphs to visulaize average, low and high prices in each city.
