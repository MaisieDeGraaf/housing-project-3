# Ontario Housing Market Analysis in Ontario <hr>

# Project Overview
1. For Project 3, we are analyzing listings in 5 cities (Oshawa, Oakville, Burlington, Vaughan and Milton) in Ontario and building a website with various filters across these 5 cities. 
2. We will be looking at the different building types (townhouses, condos & houses), prices and properties for each listing per city.
3. Using the data created, we will display the notable tendencies on maps and charts with a focus on neighborhoods.


+ Data & Delivery
We will scrape websites to obtain listings for each city and store them in a MongoDB database.
The Data will then be cleanse using a dataframe and displayed in our API endpoint using Flask.
+ Back End & Visualization
Using JS, we will create various maps using Plotly and Leaflet to display each listing filtered by prices/cities/and other possibilities.
A Bar chart will also be created to display average, low and high prices in each city.
